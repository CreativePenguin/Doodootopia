# Structured-Robot-Code

This is template code for a robot with the porpose of creating a structure for which to program in next year. For example, the interfaces used in the RobotMap. This is a good way to structure it as it helps prevent inconsistant naming with related variables. This code is based on the Alfred code, but is supposed to be quickly adapted into any robot we need to program.
